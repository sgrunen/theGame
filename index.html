		<p>The Game is our answer to all of the other role-playing games which we have been butchering over the years. The Game was crated by a goup of hardened gamers who have had to modify every system they have come across in an attempt to find gratification. Eventually we got fed up, and said,"@#$%#! Pass the Coke!" Soon after that with the Chart in hand and finals quickly approaching, we decided to create our own bloody game. Such are legends born.</p>
		<p>The Game is an amalgamation of all of the ideas we've accululated over years of gaming. Naturally, it is a masterful collage of the group's ideas.</p>
		<p>After years of Beta-testing, The Game is now a role-playing game that defies genres. The rules can be adapted to Fantasy, SteamPunk, WildWest and even Post-Apocolyptic types of worlds.</p>
		<p>This site will start your adventure by helping you roll up your own player character. Note: This site is meant to compliment the book, not replace it. Reference the book for any clarifications.</p>
		<h3>HAVE FUN!!!</h3>
